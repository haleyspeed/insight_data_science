# SubScript

## A web application for subscription services to retain customer loyalty.

Subscript is built upon two machine learning algorithms with three goals.

1. **Monitor customer engagement** and identify those users at risk for subscription lapse.
2. **Curated content recommendation** based on users' history to keep at-risk users engaged.
3. **Estimate return on investment** for curated content recommendations.
